    <h1>Pokemon Stat and Type Explorer</h1>
    <div>
        Picking individual Pokemon, as well as the types of Pokemon one would want on their starting team can be difficult.<br> 
        There are plenty of stats that make the choices difficult. Whether it is selecting based off type or specific stats,<br>
        this data visualization will help to narrow your choices based on the direction of team you want to build.
    </div>
    <h2 id="chartTitle">Average Stats by Type</h2>
    <button id="toggleChartButton">Next Chart</button>
    <div id="chart1" style="display: block;">
        <div>
            If you prioritize a specific stat (Attack, Defense, HP, etc.), then considering Pokemon type is a must. <br>
            Some types have naturally higher base stats than others. For example, if you select defense, you will <br>
            see that rock type has a higher defense stat on average than any other type. Therefore, if you want to <br>
            build your team around a specific stat, examining this chart will help.
        </div>

        <div id="annotation"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="chart2" style="display: none;">
        Most times when trying to maximize a stat for a team, one should observe how an increase in one stat can <br>
        affect other stats. To avoid over specializing, one should pick at least one other stat to try to work toward <br>
        when creating their team. This chart allows comparison of different stats for every pokemon, filtered by type. <br>
        Pokemon that excel in both stats selected will be found in the upper right of the graph. Since you have <br>
        potentially already selected a type from the last graph. Now you can compare all the Poemon within any <br>
        specific type.

            Finally, let's take a look at the best overall Pokemon. Without looking at meximizing a specific stat, by looking<br>
            at the sum of a Pokemon's stats, we can compare the best overall Pokemon. These Pokemon may not excel in any particular<br>
            stat, but are the best all-around Pokemon if one is curious about maximizing ALL stats, not any specific stat. One can<br>
            toggle through the top 100 Pokemon ranked by total stats to compare with the choices made from the previous two charts.
